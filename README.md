# COMP 562 Final Project on carbon offset prediction

The rise of sustainable energy is revolutionizing both industrial and domestic consumption. Because of this, education and awareness about the impact of certain kinds of sustainable energy sources is necessary. Solar energy, in particular, is relatively easy for everyday homeowners to capitalize on, but is also difficult to calculate the overall cost and benefit that such a choice can provide. One way to understand the potential benefit is to examine the carbon offset  caused by switching to solar energy. A carbon offset is a reduction or removal of emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases made in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. Our goal was to create machine learning models to predict this carbon offset, which would hopefully provide insight into the effectiveness of solar energy for a given area. Predicting the impact on global warming and environmental health that our decisions will have is crucial to sustainable development, which is what this project aims to do.
